            <p class="nb_content">Step into Rat’s bedroom and you quickly learn that this is a person not afraid of expressing themselves. This is the room of a musician, artist, child model, YouTuber, and budding entrepreneur for a small apparel company. A guitar rests in the corner, waiting to be picked up. Clothes in bold colors and designs line the racks. But despite all of these avenues for expression, there is one deeply personal message that this performer wants heard more than anything else.</p>
            <p class="nb_content">“Our beautiful, unfortunately mismatched bodies are mangled with stab wounds, angry men’s fury,” declared Rat Gemmiti, now 20, in a poem delivered to high school peers in the student library. And with that, Rat, who grew up in New York City, told their high school and the world that they were non-binary transgender. It was January 16, 2015.</p>
            <p class="nb_content">Rat entered a new world of self-awareness and discovery. No longer did Rat refer to themselves as “male” or “female.” Since that day, Rat has preferred the pronouns “they” or “them,” a practice that is common among the increasing number of people who identify as non-binary.</p>
            <p class="nb_content">“Non-binary” is a term unfamiliar to many, but it has been adopted by a subset of transgender people who identify as neither male or female, or both male and female at the same time. Actresses like Caitlyn Jenner and Laverne Cox have helped bring the transgender community into the spotlight, paving the way for greater acceptance of their identities, but non-binary is a category much less well-known or understood.</p>
            <p class="nb_content">In Portland, Oregon, 53-year-old Jamie Shupe, who also uses the pronoun “they,” has achieved a remarkable victory as a non-binary transgender person. They became the first person to obtain a driver’s license with the gender “X,” the state’s designation for those who identify as neither male or female, and who are demanding that society and its institutions recognize them for who they are.</p>
            <p class="nb_content">Shupe was denied the right to explore gender and sexual orientation as a youth and while in the military. Shupe has been retired for two years and has gone through hormonal treatments “trying desperately to turn my body into something that resembled a female.” But through the hormonal treatments, Shupe said they realized that trying to achieve a different gender wasn’t going to work.</p>
            <p class="nb_content">It is estimated that non-binary individuals make up at least 25 percent of transgender populations, according to the Society For The Psychological Study of LGBT Issues. Non-binary transgender people face a struggle for acceptance not only from family and society, but also from the LGBTQ community.</p>
            <p class="nb_content">“When I first found out what the word ‘non-binary’ was, I had that moment where  the floor bottomed out and I was like, ‘Oh my God! Everything makes sense!’” Rat said.</p>
            <p class="nb_content">After they came out as non-binary, Rat named themselves after a Japanese animation character named Nezumi, which means “rat” in English. Rat describes their namesake as a “post-apocalyptic cross-dressing bad ass.”</p>
            <p class="nb_content">“I figured I’d start with the name and go from there,” Rat said of aspiring to be a “bad ass” like Nezumi, adding that they took inspiration “from the first representation of people like me who don’t fit in a box.”</p>
            <p class="nb_content">But getting to that place has not been easy. Rat has faced mental health issues because of their identity.</p>
            <p class="nb_content">“I was struggling with body dysmorphic issues and eating disorders, and I just really didn’t know what was going on,” Rat said of their early teenage years. Coming out as non-binary “helped me [understand myself] better physically and mentally. It overall bettered my life,” they said.</p>
            <p class="nb_content">Though Rat and Shupe have finally found a label and have accepted their nonconformity to traditional gender definitions, they still face difficulties while navigating relationships and communicating their identity to others. They often face hostility and ignorance.</p>
            <p class="nb_content">“You can’t exactly come out to the whole world at once. Every time you meet a new person, every time you see a family member that you haven’t seen in a long time, it’s the same conversation over and over again,” Rat said. “I’m constantly coming out to people.”</p>
            <p class="nb_content">For others, identifying as non-binary didn’t come in a moment of epiphany. Gender identification is not only about one’s own experience of gender, but is also based on what we’ve been taught about gender and what we have internalized starting at birth, according to Margot Abels, a professor focused on gender studies at Northeastern University.</p>
